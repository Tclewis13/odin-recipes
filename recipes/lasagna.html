    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In ancient Rome, there was a dish similar to a traditional lasagna called lasana or lasanum (Latin for 'container' or 'pot') described in the book De re coquinaria by Marcus Gavius Apicius,[4] but the word could have a more ancient origin. The first theory is that lasagna comes from Greek λάγανον (laganon), a flat sheet of pasta dough cut into strips.[5][6][7][8] The word λαγάνα (lagana) is still used in Greek to mean a flat thin type of unleavened bread baked for the holiday Clean Monday.</p>
    <p>Another theory is that the word lasagna comes from the Greek λάσανα (lasana) or λάσανον (lasanon) meaning 'trivet', 'stand for a pot' or 'chamber pot'.[9][10][11] The Romans borrowed the word as lasanum, meaning 'cooking pot'.[12] The Italians used the word to refer to the cookware in which lasagna is made. Later the food took on the name of the serving dish.</p>
